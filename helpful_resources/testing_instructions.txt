In the terminal, navigate to the \ranking_app\client directory.
    The full path is C:\CS_courses\CS361\ranking_app\client>

Then, type 'npm run dev' and press enter in the terminal. This should print the following:
 VITE v6.3.4  ready in 765 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help

Visit the localhost link (ctr + click on it)

When finished with testing, use ctrl + c in the terminal to close the port.

Run python app.py in a separate terminal to start the proxy server on port 5000.
    The full path is C:\CS_courses\CS361\ranking_app\flask>
    This is needed for running the flask service (which allows the python microservices
    to run on python sockets while still working with http requests)
        Note that this also requires having downloaded flask with "pip flask" while in 
        the /flask directory as well as flask_cors using "pip flask-cors"
